1. Usage

You need have a java runtime installed to use jasm6502.
jasm6502 was developed with java version 1.4.

Invoke jasm6502 from the shell with one source file to assemble as parameter.
Example:

$ java jasm6502 source.asm

The resulting binary will be source.bin.

Further commandline options:
-f <format>
        <format> can be:
        screen  - Output assembly to screen
        raw     - Output to raw binary file
        c64     - Output to Commodore 64 .prg file
-o <output file name>
-t <translate ascii> (Translates to commodore 64 screencodes)
        <translate ascii> can be:
        upper   - Translate to upper case (Default in c64 format)
        lower   - Translate to lower case
        none    - Supress translation
        
The translation to upper case/lowercase is needed when outputting strings directly to screen memory in c64.
If using kernels CHROUT ($ffd2) use no ascii translation.

Example:

$ java jasm6502 -f c64 source.asm
This will assemble source.asm and output a Commodore 64 emulated tape file, with filename source.prg.

2. Features

jasm6502 understands the standard set of 6502 opcodes.
Sourcefiles without specified origin address defaults to origin $1000.
A list of jasm6502 current features follows.

2.1.1 Labels
-------------------------------------------------------------

Labels in the source can be defined at any point.
Label names should have colons as postfix, but it is not necessary.
Any word in the source not defined as a keyword will be interpreted as a label,
when defined on a single line, or before a valid statement, as long as they are declared
in the first column of the line.

Example:

label1:		lda #<string			; valid label "label1"
			sta addr
			lda #>string
			sta addr
			jsr output_string
			rts
string							; valid label "string", no postfix but still valid since declared on col 1.
		.byt "hello world", 0
	addr	.word 0				; invalid label "addr", because no postfix colon and not declared on col 1.


2.1.2 Anonymous Labels
-------------------------------------------------------------

Anonymous labels can be specified any number of times.
Theese labels are specified by using the anynynous label operator, which
is defined as at-sign, or at-sign followed by a colon.
The anonymous labels can be jumped to by using at-sign followed by f or b,
meaning forward or backwards (- or + is synonymous). Anonymous labels are helpful in that you 
don't need come up with new label names.
Example:

		ldx #0
@:		lda $1000, x
		cmp #0
		beq @f			; jumps forward to next anonymous label
		sta $0400, x
		inx
		bpl @b			; jumps backward to previous anonymous label
@:		rts

2.2 Expressions
-------------------------------------------------------------

Expressions can be used at almost any point. But the results need fit the operand size if
used with opcodes, either 8 or 16 bits depending on the addressing mode.
Supported operators are

+ : binary addition
- : binary subtraction
- : unary minus (\ is also valid)
/ : divide
* : multiplication (or current address if used as factor)
< : unary low byte of expression
> : unary high byte of expression
& : bitwise and
| : bitwise or
^ : bitwise exclusive or
<<: bitwise shift left
>>: bitwise shift right
~ : bitwise not

Expressions may be within any number of parentheses.

The presedence of the operators are evaluated as follows: (higher level evaluated before lower)

level		operators
3			~ < > unary -
2			* / << >> & ^
1			+ - |

-------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 Identifiers

Identifiers may be specified and assigned values from constants, labels or expressions.
The identifier names must start with a letter, and may contain digits or underlines.
Example:

var1 = $02
var2 = buffer

		lda var1
		inx
		sta buffer, x
		rts
buffer:

-------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 Special operators

Some operators have special meaning to jasm6502.

The # operator

Specifies that the following expression is a byte constant, and not an address in ram.
This is used to differ between immediate mode and other addressing modes refering to ram.
Example:

lda #5		; load accumulator with the value 5
lda 5		; load accumulator with the contents at memory address $0005

The $ operator

Acts as a hexadecimal radix operator specifying that the constant that must follow, is base 16.
Without this operator all constants are evaluated as decimal.
Example:

lda $c000	; load accumulator with the contents at memory address $c000 (49152)

The % operator

Acts as a binary radix operator specifying that the constant that must follow, is in base 2.
Example:
and #%1111111	; and accumulator with value 127

The * operator

When appearing as a factor instead of multiplication operator in expression or elsewhere,
it acts like the current address in source. 

Example:

lda *		; load accumulator with the contents of the address at this point.
bne * + 2	; branch to next address.

The < and > operators

Theese operators when used before an expression or constant, takes the low and high bytes results,
respectively. This may be used when storing 16 bit values to ram.
Example that stores the 16 bit address of label message, to address $1000.

lda #<label
sta $1000
lda #>label
sta $1001
rts

message: 
	.byt "a message", 0
	
-------------------------------------------------------------

2.5 Strings and values

Strings and values might be embedded in the source, and assembled to binary.
The .byt directive is used to define ascii strings and 8 bit values, and might be
mixed and separated by comma.
Example:

.byt "message", 0					; A zero terminated ascii string
.byt 10								; 8 bit value 10
.byt $0, $ff, $fe, 256				; some mixed 8 bit values
.word $c000							; 16 bit value 49152
.word label1, label2, label3		; labels will be interpreted as their 16 bit addresses

-------------------------------------------------------------

2.6 origin addresses

The origin address might at any point be set with .org or *= directives with the following restrictions:
the origin cannot be set to an address behind the current one, thus it is not possible begin source code
at $2000 and then at some point in source set origin to $1000.
A second restriction is that the origin might not be set to zero page, in other words origin must 
be equal to or above $100.

If the origin address is set forward, the space between last assembled opcode and the opcodes that
assembles at the new origin address, will be filled with zeros.

Example:

* = $1000			; Assemble code to $1000
		lda $02
		sta $c000
		rts
* = $2000			; Assemble following code to $2000 (zeros will be stuffed between here and previous code)
		and #ff
		
-------------------------------------------------------------

2.7 include files

By using the include directive additional source files might be included in the source file that is assembled.
Theese will be assembled as well, like if their contents were injected at the point in the source file they were
included. Note that since of this fact, it is important to end each source file that is included with a new line
character. If not, the assembler might see the last statement in the included file merged by another statement in current file.

Example:

*=$1000
		jmp start					; jump past included code, to label start.

		include "routines.asm"		; include file routines.asm
		include "constants.asm"		; include file constants.asm

start:	jsr my_super_routine		; call one of the routines defined in routines.asm
		lda #data					; load accumulator with one of constants defined in constants.asm
		
-------------------------------------------------------------

2.8 Procedures and scoping

Additional levels of scoping can be achieved by using the Procedure directive ".proc".
The syntax is:
.proc procedure_name
	; ...
.endproc

The procedure directive has to be matched by the End Procedure directive ".endproc".
All labels and identifiers that are defined inside the .proc/.endproc block are not visible to the outside.
The code inside the .proc/.endproc block does have access to labels/identifiers below the procedures scope.
Labels and identifiers defined inside a procedure can have same name as outside labels without errors.
Nested procedures are allowed.
Creating a procedure effectively creates a new namespace for that procedure and all of its nested procedure.
Anonymous labels defined inside procedure blocks are local as well.

Example 1:

lab1:	lda #<lab1
		ldx #>lab1
		jsr a_procedure
		jmp @f				; jumps past proc to next local label
		
		.proc a_procedure	; start procedure
			lab1:	ldy #0	; lab1 defined as local to procedure, not colliding with outside lab1
			; ....more code...
			@:		rts		; Anonymous labels are local to procedure as well.
		.endproc			; end procedure

@:		; ..more code...

-------------------------------------------------------------

2.9 Comments

Comments can be added by using characters ; or !.
Everything on a line following the comment-character, is ignored by the assembler.
Example:

; This is a comment
! This is also a comment
	lda #0
	sta $d020	; comments after statement
	sta $d021	! comments after statement

4. Bugs
	File including recursion is not fixed. If a file should include itself, it will hang until java runs out of memory.
	
	Assembler never takes upper bound on assembly, thus assembler binaries might exceed 64 kb.
